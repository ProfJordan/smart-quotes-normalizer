# Smart Quotes Normalizer for VSCode

## Overview

The Smart Quotes Normalizer is a lightweight VSCode Plugin designed to seamlessly convert smart quotes to standard quotes within your code. This essential tool ensures consistency in string quotations, preventing errors that can arise from the automatic conversion of standard quotes to smart quotes in various Microsoft products like Outlook and Word.

## Background

A personal experience a decade ago highlighted a subtle yet frustrating issue: spending over four hours debugging an HTML email due to smart quotes introduced by copying code from Microsoft Outlook. This issue, seemingly small, can lead to significant time loss and confusion, especially for those unaware of the subtle changes in their code.

Recently, witnessing a student encounter the same problem rekindled my resolve to address this issue once and for all. Hence, the creation of this plugin.

## Features

Automatic Conversion: Effortlessly converts smart quotes (“ ” ‘ ’) to their standard counterparts ("" '') in your code, ensuring compatibility and preventing syntax errors.

Easy to Use: Integrates directly into VSCode, working silently in the background to correct quotes without interrupting your workflow.

Customizable Settings: Offers the flexibility to enable or disable automatic conversion based on your preferences and project needs.

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar, or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
3. Search for "Smart Quotes Normalizer".
4. Click on the Install button to add the plugin to your VSCode setup.

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin automatically detects and converts smart quotes in your active file. You can customize its behavior and toggle the feature on or off through the extension settings, accessible via `File > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Smart Quotes Normalizer`.

## Why Use Smart Quotes Normalizer?

This plugin is more than a convenience; it's a solution to a real-world problem that can disrupt the coding process and introduce errors into your projects. By ensuring your quotes are consistently standardized, the Smart Quotes Normalizer saves you from the hidden pitfalls of code copied from applications that automatically alter text formatting.

Embrace peace of mind and enhance your coding efficiency with the Smart Quotes Normalizer for VSCode.
